(ooooooooo)


[Verse 1]
I remember the way you’d hold my hand,
Soft and strong like the shifting sand.
Taught me how to stand so tall,
Through every rise, through every fall.

[Pre-Chorus]
You were fire, you were grace,
A quiet storm, a warm embrace.
No one could ever take your place,
Not in my heart, not in this space.

[Chorus]
I just wanted to tell you that I love youuuuu
Every memory, every memory, we will forever think of youuuuu
In the end, your love still shines in our hearts (true)
Every memory, every memory, we’ll always remember youuuuuu

[Verse 2]
People said I didn’t belong,
But you showed me they were wrong.
Blonde hair, blue eyes, still your blood,
A contradiction wrapped in love.

[Bridge]
You were fierce, never afraid to speak,
But your kindness ran just as deep.
If I could hold you one more time,
I’d tell you how you shaped my life.

[Chorus]
I just wanted to tell you that I love youuuuu
Every memory, every memory, we will forever think of youuuuu
In the end, your love still shines in our hearts (true)
Every memory, every memory, we’ll always remember youuuuuu

[Verse]
You can watch us from heaven now,
Smiling down, so free, so proud.
Every star, every night,
Guiding us with your golden light.

[Outro]
(ooooooooo)
(ooooooooo)
(ooooooooo)
(ooooooooo)
