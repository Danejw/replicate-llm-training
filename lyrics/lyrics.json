[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Woke up late, my rent is due
Checked my phone—my bank account said, ("Dude…")
Ate some cereal with a fork (no milk)
Now I'm Googling, "Why do I feel so ill?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Every email feels like a threat (ding!)
My student loans, they still ain't left
"Buy a house"? Oh, that's a joke
Guess I’ll just Venmo until I'm broke

[Chorus]
Adulting is a scam! (it's a scam, it's a scam!)
Nobody told me ‘bout this plan (what the hell, Uncle Sam?)
They said, “Grow up, get a job” (yeah right!)
But I just wanna do what I like (what I like)

[Verse 2]
Assembling IKEA, lost the screws (oops)
Therapy costs more than my shoes
"Self-care" means staring at the wall
And debating if I should risk it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Every paycheck says "not enough" (not enough!)
Cost of eggs? Bro, this is rough
Retirement? Can’t relate
Guess I’ll vibe check my credit fate

[Chorus]
Adulting is a scam! (big scam, huge scam!)
I was tricked into this jam (bruh, where’s the refund plan?)
They said, “Work hard, you’ll go far”
Now I’m just crying in my car

[Bridge]
Swipe left on commitment, swipe right for a nap
I used to dream big, now I just wanna cap
At the bar like, “Drinks on me!”
(But actually, split the bill evenly)

[Chorus]
Adulting is a scam! (can I opt out?)
All I wanted was a snack (now I gotta file tax?!)
They said, “Life’s great in your prime”
But I just wanna rewind time

[Outro]
Set that email to “unread”
Take a nap, stay in bed
If life’s a game, I call "no fair"
But at least I still have healthcare

[Intrumental Outro]








[Verse 1]
Flipped through old photos on my cracked iPhone (oops)
Back when rent was cheap and my spine wasn’t blown (ouch)
Had dreams of greatness, now I just crave sleep
And a day where gas ain’t twenty bucks a leap

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I miss the days when Wi-Fi was free
And my biggest stress was a Tamagotchi
Now it’s emails and bills and existential dread
And asking, “Did I drink enough water?” before bed

[Chorus]
But I just wanna rewind time! (press rewind, press rewind!)
Back when I thought my future’d shine (lol, what a lie)
No taxes, no debt, just staying up late
Playing Pokémon and thinking life was great

[Verse 2]
Remember when plans were just “Meet me at noon”?
Now it’s Google Calendar and six different Zooms (ugh)
When "Netflix and chill" was an innocent phrase
Before my back started hurting in mysterious ways

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I miss the days of Blockbuster nights
Before my paycheck went to overpriced flights
Now my joints pop like bubble wrap
And my only vacation is a midday nap

[Chorus]
But I just wanna rewind time! (go back, go back!)
To dial-up tones and a Razor that clacked
No algorithms stealing my brain
Just MySpace top friends causing minor pain

[Bridge]
Let’s go back to no-read-receipts
When our biggest flex was burning CDs
I’d trade my 401k for just one chance
To moonwalk back to my cargo pants

[Chorus]
But I just wanna rewind time! (VHS, press eject!)
When the world felt fun, not just full of debt
They said “Enjoy your youth, it flies right by”
Now I’m crying over rent and wondering why

[Outro]
Rewind, rewind, let me relive
One carefree day with no bills to give
I’d pause the past, and play it slow
Back when I thought I’d have life in control...








[Intrumental Intro]

[Intro]
Look, we work hard, we grind
But we ain’t living nine to five
Ooh, we’re chasing dreams on our own time


[Verse 1]
All these bills gotta get paid
But we don’t wanna be a cliché
Ain’t running in the rat race


[Verse 2]
Worker bees, they go, go, go
Yeah, our souls ain't sold for the do-o-ough
We just wanna put on a show (oh, oh , oh)


[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t nothing wrong with living it up
Just have fun as we turn it up
We’d rather laugh than get burned out
So shout it out

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)

[Verse 3]
Remake that nine to five
Take the leap, keep the dream alive
We’re gonna thrive, we’re gonna drive

[Verse 4]
So let the good times flow, flow, flow
Play that song and let it roll, roll, roll
We’re gonna lose all contro-o-ol (oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t nothing wrong with living it up
Just have fun as we turn it up
We’d rather laugh than get burned out
So shout it out

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (what I like)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (my own life)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (what I like)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (my own life)

[Sensei Jab Break]
I like wearing comfy clothes
I like long, deep YouTube scrolls
I like not doing what I’m told
I like figuring it out on my own

I like being on Hawaiian Time
I like memes that make me laugh
I like the fish and the poi
I like thinking I'm a big boy

I like hanging with people that's cool
I like dancing like a fool
I like waking up on the grass
I like saying “Never again” 
(but do it next weekend)


[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)


[Dance Solo]


[Verse 5]
We’re gonna jump, jump, jump
We’re gonna laugh, laugh, laugh
We’re gonna party every day (aye, aye, aye)
Till the morning comes
We’re gonna run, run, run
We’re gonna play, play, play
Ain’t nothing standing in our way (aye, aye, aye)

[Outro]
I wanna, wanna (I wanna, wanna)
I wanna, wanna (I wanna, wanna)
I wanna, wanna (I wanna, wanna)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
