[Verse 1]
There’s a whisper in the hallway (hush)
Soft as smoke, cold as stone
Crawls beneath my bed at midnight
Says my name when I’m alone (alone...)

[Pre-Chorus]
It knows my steps, it knows my fears
Humming a tune only I can hear
The more I run, the more it clings
Lingering till the night unstrings

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, the thing in the dark (creep)
Creeping, breathing, tearing me apart
Oh, oh, I fight, I fight (battle cry)
Yet it rises with the morning light (rise)

[Verse 2]
No footprints left, no trace behind
Yet somehow, it's here every time
I close my eyes, but still it clings
A shadow built on forgotten things

[Pre-Chorus]
It steals my voice, echoes my name
A twisted song in a haunting game
I break its hold, slam shut the door (bang)
But it’s back again, like before

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, the thing in the dark (creep)
Creeping, breathing, tearing me apart
Oh, oh, I fight, I fight (keep fighting)
Yet it returns with the morning light (rise)

[Bridge]
Blade in hand, heart set on fire
One more battle, one more trial
I tear it down, stake my claim
But still it reaches, calling my name

[Outro]
Night descends, the silence calls (whisper)
I face the dark, I will not fall
It might return, it might remain
I’ll fight the night—again and again






sitting in a dark room, 
all alone with no one,
feeling empty
facing my greatest fears


ooooo oooo ooooo
ooooo oooo ooooo 

the shadow even in the dark
haunts my mind and never gives up
always lingering in the back of my mind
creeepin crreepin closer and closer


Its darker than a shadow in a unlit room
oooooooo its always there creeeeepin through 
Its darker than a shadow in a unlit room
oooooooo its always there making its moooove










make these lyrics a journey, a story that builds tension into the chorus repeatedly with each verse and bridge

I want to express the darkness of loneliness, darker than a shadow in an unlit room. 



darker than a shadow in an unlit room


I try soo hard, to fight (I fight)
Every day it returns and I fight again (and again)
How long can I make this last. 
In the end, it doesn't even matter. 

I can only push it away for soo long
but it keeps creepin in 

I try to supress it, 
I drunk my life into numbeness.
but it comes back stronger
more powerful. 

I let it take control
only to leave me dead
in my bed cant get up
everything i tried just didnt get me up

I had to gain it all back
Convince the demon he was wrong
I had to take over control 
Or else we would have ended it all










[Chorus]
I just wanted to tell you that I love youuuuuuu
Every memory, every memory we will forever think of youuuuuu
In the end your memories will forever in our hearts trueeeeeee
Every melody, every melody we'll always remember youuuuuu


you can watch us from heaven, 



I love how people would tell me im not, 
then you show up and you were proof. 
Im blonde with blue eyes, you were the way im prove my not,
I love the contradiction you gave them.

You were strong, didnt give shit to anything 
but at the same time lovingly kind. 
I cant ask for any thing differnt
you were one of a kind. 





[Verse 1]
I remember the way you’d hold my hand,
Soft and strong like the shifting sands.
Taught me how to stand up tall,
Through every rise, and every fall.

[Pre-Chorus]
You were fire, you were grace,
At the alley, a can remember your face.
No one could ever take your place,
Not in my heart, not in this space.

[Chorus]
I just wanted to tell you that I love youuuuu
Every memory, we will forever think of youuuuu
In the end, your love still shines in our hearts trueeeeeeeee
Every melody, we’ll always remember youuuuuu

[Intrumental]

[Verse 2]
People said I didn’t belong,
But you showed me they were wrong.
Blonde hair, blue eyes, still your blood,
A contradiction wrapped in love.

[Bridge]
You were fierce, never afraid to speak,
But your kindness ran just as deep.
If I could hold you one more time,
I’d tell you how you shaped my life.

[Outro]
You can watch us from heaven now,
Smiling down, so free, so proud.
Every star, every night, so loud
Guiding us with your golden light.

[End]

[Unconditional Love]
A Song for Granny

[Verse 1]
Didn’t know she could sing ‘til that first karaoke night,
Hit a note, sent Aunty Moemi screamin’ with hype.
Pocket full of quarters in that purple Crown Royal bag,
I’d run up, she’d laugh, “Go on, grab what you need”

[Pre-Chorus]
She had fire, she had fight,
But damn, she loved us right.
Didn’t care what the world had to say,
She was ridin’ shotgun in our lives every day.

[Chorus]
She rolled through life like a ball down the lane,
Strike or spare, love stayed the same.
Took the hits, took the falls,
Stood her ground, stood for us all.
Granny’s love, you don’t question or doubt,
If you were hers, she’d knock the whole world out.

[Verse 2]
Built a brick pad out back only thirteen,
Laid every stone while she tended her greens.
When we were done, she leaned back in her chair,
Laughed, “Go grab us a beer—Rodney won’t care.”

[Pre-Chorus]
She had fire, she had fight,
But damn, she loved us right.
Didn’t care what the world had to say,
She was ridin’ shotgun in our lives every day.

[Chorus]
She rolled through life like a ball down the lane,
Strike or spare, love stayed the same.
Took the hits, took the falls,
Stood her ground, stood for us all.
Granny’s love, you don’t question or doubt,
If you were hers, she’d knock the whole world out.

[Bridge]
Her Camaro was faster, but I still kept up,
Rollin’ to Nanakuli, thinkin’ we was tough.
Stood up front, got the cops all tight,
Granny jumped out first, “That’s my daughter, alright?”
No seatbelt, got the ticket, but man, she had style,
Could talk down a cop with just half a smile.

[Outro]
She fought for us, she fed us, she sang us to sleep,
Kept our secrets, held our hands, made our roots run deep.
And though she’s gone, her love don’t fade,
It’s in every song, every bowl of soup she made.
(Always here, never gone)
Granny’s love still rolls on.




lets find a good hook, and places to use repetition 

"Granny take me back to the good ol days"

[intro to setup for the next verse (chronological)]
Rollin up to the Nanakuli Lanes, 
78 Camaro bumpin, the music playin
No cares in the world, we know we were stylin

[verse about the bowling]
we all remember the days from the alley
singing to the tunes of the 'Good Ol Days'
hitting notes, we couldnt have imagined

[Verse about her cooking]
we can forget the ono grinds
got that podagee bean soup all the time
however she makes it, always turns out fine
damn, we gotta get that recipe in mind

[Chorus or pre chorus]
she's always is down, she aint foolin around
she got your back, no need to make a sound
Granny’s love, you don’t question or doubt,
If you were hers, she’d knock the whole world out.

laying bricks, always tending her garden,
13 years old, we our first beers together like that 
after a long day of work in the country
dont mess it up or she'll run out with a bat. 




[verse about bingo]






[Intro]
Rollin’ up to Nanakuli Lanes,
‘78 Camaro hummin’, wind in my face.
Windows down, music loud,
Didn’t have much, but we sure stood proud.




[Intro]
(ooooooo)
(ooooooo)
(ooooooo)
(ooooooo)

[Verse 1]
We all remember the nights at the alley,
Singing to the tunes of the Good ol’ Daaaays.
She stole the show, made ‘em all feel it.
Hittin' notes we could hardly believe it.

[Verse 2]
Can’t forget the grinds, she knew the kind we liked,
Portuguese bean soup always hittin' right.
No need no recipe, just a pot and memories,
Every bite takes us back so effortlessly.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through every lane, through every game,
Through every meal, she called our names.
She lived full speed, she ran it like that,
And if you crossed us? Better watch that bat!

[Chorus]
She Rolled through life like a ball down the lane,
Strike or spare, her love stayed the same.
Took the hits, took the falls,
Stood her ground, stood for us all.
Her love, no question, no doubt,
If you were her's, she’d knock the whole world out.
(ooooooo)
(ooooooo)


[Bridge]
(Take me back, tell me 'bout the good ol days)
Where the lanes lit up and the music played.
(Take me back, tell me ‘bout the good ol’ days)
Quarters in hand, Karaoke, she led the way.
(Take me back, tell me 'bout the good ol days)
To the smell of the soup on a Sunday afternoon,
(Take me back, tell me 'bout the good ol’ days)
Where love filled the air like an old school tune.

[Verse 3]
Laying bricks, tending her greens,
Thirteen years old, she put me on the team.
Worked till sundown, sat back with a laugh,
First beers together—Don’t tell (or I'll kick your ass)

[Verse 4]
Bingo's her game, numbers in play,
Lucky seat, same spot every day.
Call her numbers, hear her cheer,
Win or not, she ran it here.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through every lane, through every game,
Through every meal, she called our names.
She lived full speed, no looking back,
And if you crossed us? Better watch that bat!

[Chorus]
She Rolled through life like a ball down the lane,
Strike or spare, her love stayed the same.
Took the hits, took the falls,
Stood her ground, stood for us all.
Her love, no question, no doubt,
If you were her's, she’d knock the whole world out.

[Bridge] (Smooth, melodic build-up, emotional lift)
(Take me back, tell me about the good ol days)
To the lanes, to the songs, to the long, long nights,
Where the cards were marked and the stars shined bright.
(Granny, take me back, take me back, ohhh...)
To the smell of the soup on a Sunday noon,
Where love filled the air like an old sweet tune.
