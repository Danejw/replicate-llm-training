[intro]
Everybody 
Everybody
Hey everybody 
Everybody

[drama]
This is a lesson, that I've lived
This is a lesson, that I've lived (I lived)
Then this is a message, 
that I'd love to give (to give)


[verse]
If Love lived, 
If I've never loved, I’ve never lived it.
If I've never lived, I've never loved, 
And if I've never loved, I’d never wanna live it. 

[pre-chorus]
This is what I've been 
I said what I've been 
what ive been
In this day,
I’d thought I've lived 
Thought that I've been 

[pre-drop]
But you know


[chorus]
I'd do it again, I'd do it again,
I'd do it again, and I'll love it!
Again, again and again
I’d thought I did everything that I did (I did)
To live a life that I’d live again
It made me everything that I’ve been
Again and again and again

[bridge]
I thought that everything that I've did
I loved it, it was what I thought was love is, what life is

[chorus]
I thought that I'd lived, that I did it, I loved it, I did 
If I could live it, I would live it, I'd do it
Again, again and again
I'd do it again, and I'll love it!

[drama]
This is a lesson, that I've lived
This is a lesson, that I've lived (I lived)
Then this is a message, 
that I'd love to give (to give)

[pre-chorus]
This is what I've been (through)
I said what I've been (through)
What I've been (through)
In this day, I’d thought I've lived (through)
Thought that I've been (through)


[pre-drop]
But you know

[chorus]
I'd do it again, I'd do it again,
I'd do it again, and I'll love it!
Again, again and again
I’d thought i did everything that I can (I can)
To live a life that I’d live again
Again, again and again
I'd do it again, and I'll love it!

[outro]
I’d thought i did everything that I can (I did)
To live a life that I’d live again
It made me everything that I am
I’d live it again
