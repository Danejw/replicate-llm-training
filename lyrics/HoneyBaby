[Verse 1]
I saw you there standing under the mango tree
A beautiful woman who looked so fine to me

[Pre-Chorus]
She had all the things that I've been searching for
She had beach blonde hair, a flower in her ear, and these little shorts

[Chorus]
She's my honey baby, my honey baby yeah
My honey baby, my honey baby yeah

[Verse 2]
So girl I want you to know that wherever you go
I won't be far away
As I kiss your lips while you sway your hips
You'll just hear me say

[Chorus]
She's my honey baby, my honey baby yeah
My honey baby, my honey baby yeah

[Verse 3]
Me say my sweet honey baby yes you know I love you so
So hold on tight and baby never let go
Because you know that when you call me
I'll be there when I can
And you can count on me cause I'm your "Superwoman"

[Chorus]
She's my honey baby, my honey baby yeah
My honey baby, my honey baby yeah

[Verse 4]
Girl I just told you how I feel for you
And every word I said, yes you know it's true
Before I go there's just one more thing, my darling
I give you total commitment girl with this wedding ring

[Chorus]
She's my honey baby, my honey baby yeah
My honey baby, my honey baby yeah

[Verse 5]
Yes I want you to know that you're mine
All of the time, rain or shine
Girl you're mine
Yes I want you to know that you're mine
All of the time, rain or shine
Girl you're mine

[Chorus]
She's my honey baby, my honey baby yeah
My honey baby, my honey baby yeah

[Verse 1]
Saw you laughing under that banyan tree
Sunlight dancing where your eyes met me

[Pre-Chorus]
She had that island glow, barefoot in the sand
Golden curls swayin’, flower in her hand

[Chorus]
She’s my honey baby, my island lady, yeah
My honey baby, my island lady, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh girl, wherever you roam, you know I’ll stay
When the moonlight calls, I won’t drift away

[Chorus]
She’s my honey baby, my island lady, yeah
My honey baby, my island lady, yeah

[Verse 3]
Me say my sweet island woman, love you deep like the sea
Hold me close, don’t ever set me free
And when you whisper soft, I feel it in my soul
You got my heart, you got my love to hold

[Chorus]
She’s my honey baby, my island lady, yeah
My honey baby, my island lady, yeah

[Verse 4]
Before I go, just one thing left to say
With this ring, I promise I’ll never drift away

[Chorus]
She’s my honey baby, my island lady, yeah
My honey baby, my island lady, yeah
