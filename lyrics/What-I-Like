[Intrumental Intro]

[Intro]
We work hard, we grind
But we won't live the nine to five
Ooh, we’re chasing dreams on our own time

[Verse 1]
All these bills gotta get paid, (paid)
But we don’t wanna be a cliché (cliché)
Ain’t running in the rat race (everyday)

[Verse 2]
Just like bees, they go, go, go
Yeah, selling their souls for the do-o-ough
We just wanna put on a sho-o-ow (for yo-oh)


[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t nothing wrong with living it uuup
Just have fun as we turn it uuup
We’d rather laugh than get burned out
This your time to shout it out

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)

[Verse 3]
Remake that nine to fiiiive
Take the leap, keep the dream aliiiive
We’re gonna thriiiive, we’re gonna driiiive

[Verse 4]
So let the good times flow, flow, flow
Play that song and let it roll, roll, roll
We’re gonna lose all contro-o-ol (oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t nothing wrong with living it uuup
Just have fun as we turn it uuup
We’d rather laugh than get burned out
This your time to shout it out

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (what I like)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (my own life)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (what I like)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (my own life)

[Rap]
I like wearing comfy clothes
I like long, deep YouTube scrolls
I like not doing what I’m told
I like figuring it out on my own
I like being on Hawaiian Time
I like sunsets that blow my mind
I like the fish and the poi
I like thinkin' I'm a big boy
I like hanging with people that's cool
I like dancing like a fool
I like waking up on the grass
I like saying “Never again” 
(but do it next weekend)

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)

[Dance Solo]

[Verse 5]
We’re gonna jump, jump, jump
We’re gonna laugh, laugh, laugh
We’re gonna party every day (aye, aye, aye)

[Verse 6]
We’re gonna run, run, run
We’re gonna play, play, play
and We're gonna do it our way (aye, aye, aye)

[Pre-Chrus]
I wanna, wanna (I wanna, wanna)
I wanna, wanna (I wanna, wanna)
I wanna, wanna (I wanna, wanna)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I wanna, wanna live my own life (my own life)
I wanna, wanna do what I like (what I like)
I just wanna live my own damn life (my own life)
