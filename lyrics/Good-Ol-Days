[Verse 1]
We all remember the nights at the alley,
Singing to the tunes of the Good ol’ Daaaays.
She stole the show, made ‘em all feel it.
Hittin' notes we could hardly believe it.

[Verse 2]
Can’t forget the grinds, she knew the kind we liked,
Portuguese bean soup always hittin' right.
No need no recipe,
just a pot and memories,

[Pre-Chorus]
Through every lane, through every game,
Through every meal, she called our names.
She lived full speed, she ran it like that,
And if you crossed us? Better watch that bat! (ooooooo)

[Chorus]
She Rolled through life like a ball down the lane,
Strike or spare, her love stayed the same.
Took the hits, took the falls,
Stood her ground, stood for us all.
Her love, no question, no doubt,
If you were her's, she’d knock the whole world out.
(ooooooo)
(ooooooo)


[Bridge]
(Take me back, tell me 'bout the good ol days)
Where the lanes lit up and the music played.
(Take me back, tell me ‘bout the good ol’ days)
Quarters in hand, Karaoke, she led the way.
(Take me back, tell me 'bout the good ol days)
To the sound of her voice as she set the mood.
(Take me back, tell me 'bout the good ol’ days)
Where love filled the air like an old school tune.

[Rap]
Laying bricks, tending her greens,
Thirteen years old, she put me on the scene.
Worked till sundown, sat back with a laugh,
First beers together—Don’t tell (or I'll kick your ass)

Bingo's her game, numbers in play,
Lucky seat, same spot every day.
Call her numbers, hear her cheer,
Win or not, she ran it here.

[Pre-Chorus]
Through every lane, through every game,
Through every meal, she called our names.
She lived full speed, no looking back,
And if you crossed us? Better watch that bat! (ooooooo)

[Chorus]
She Rolled through life like a ball down the lane,
Strike or spare, her love stayed the same.
Took the hits, took the falls,
Stood her ground, stood for us all.
Her love, no question, no doubt,
If you were her's, she’d knock the whole world out.
