[Instrumental]

They say, time heals all hearts,
but my heart's been apart. 
Built my walls to not break again,
You just dont know how long.

Since the last time It's been
(oooooo)
Since the last time I've been 
(in loooovee)

[Pre-Chorus]
Because what the hell did I do,
I've never been the type to,
let someone see right through.
But you were the one to shine through,
I must have done something right to,
To have someone just like you.

[Chorus]
I never thought, I was gonna feel love again.
I felt like, I was gonna give up on it.
But you showed me, I was wrong again. 
When this time it comes, you got me hooked on it.

I never thought I'd feel love again.
I glad it came around again..
and it's youuuuuuuu
(it's youuuuuuu)

You are the love of my life..
(you are the love of my life..)
You are the love of my life..
(you are the love of my life..)

[Pre-Chorus]
Because what the hell did I do,
I've never been the type to,
let someone see right through.
But you were the one to shine through,
I must have done something right to,
To have someone just like you.

[Chorus]
I never thought, I was gonna feel love again.
I felt like, I was gonna give up on it.
But you showed me, I was wrong again. 
When this time it comes, you got me hooked on it.

It's crazy to think that you're mine. 
(That you're mine)
I really don't think this is real life. 
(That you're the love of my life..)

You are the love of my life..
(you are the love of my life..)
You are the love of my life..
(you are the love of my life..)

[Pre-Chorus]
What the hell did I do,
I've never been the type to 
let someone see right through.
But you were the one to shine through
I must have done something right to
To have someone just like you

[Outro]
It's a dream come truueeeeeeeeeee
A dream come truueeeeeeeeee
Everytime i close my eyes
I think of youuuu
(I think of youuuu)

[Instrumental]
